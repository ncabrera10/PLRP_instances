# VRPTR_instances

Instances for the VRPTR proposed by Coindreau  et  al.  (2019).
Each instance considers a number of clients n = {20,30,40,50} located inside a square grid of 10 kilometers by 10 kilometers.  
The depot is located at the center of the grid.  
To compute distances between customers and the depot, the Euclidian distance is used.
In addition, to compute driving and walking times they consider a driving speed of 30 km/h  and a walking speed a 4 kilometers/hours.  
The customer service  times  range  between  20  and  35  minutes.   
Finally,  the  maximum walking  distance  for  each  worker  is  5  kilometers  and  the  day  duration  is 7  hours  (i.e.,  420  minutes).   
An  instance  is  referred  as  ”n_A_i”,  where  n stands for the number of customers.  
A total of 10 instances are considered for each number of customers.
